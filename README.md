## Project Goals

- **Identify Popular Categories**: Analyze which app categories are most popular.
- **App Installations**: Find apps with the highest number of installs.
- **App Sizes and Ratings**: Investigate trends in app sizes, ratings, and other attributes.
- **Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering**: Perform data cleaning, handle missing values, and engineer relevant features for analysis.

## Steps in the Project

1. **Data Cleaning**: Clean the dataset by handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing duplicates.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explore the dataset to uncover patterns, distributions, and relationships among various features.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features based on existing data to enhance analysis and modeling.
4. **Visualization**: Use visualizations to better understand the distribution and trends within the data.

## Libraries Used

- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `numpy` for numerical operations
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization
- `warnings` for filtering out warnings

## Key Insights

- Most popular app categories, based on the number of installations.
- Top 5 most installed apps in each popular category.
- Analysis of app pricing, size, and rating distributions.
- Number of apps with 5-star ratings.

## Usage

You can run this analysis by executing the code in the Jupyter Notebook or Python script. Ensure the following dependencies are installed:
